2048 â€“ Player (Brayden and Cameron)
	The algorithm denoted as player in the repository is designed to maximize the score of a 2048 game. The algorithm works by calculating the state of the game after playing about 3 to 4 moves. The state of the game is calculated by the computer simulating all four moves a player could make and then simulating the placement of a tile on the game board at every possible position accounting for the probability of a 2 or 4 being placed on the game board. The algorithm takes the expected value or average of scores after the tiles have been placed and returns the average of scores. The score is calculated by a heuristic function because the actual game scoring weighs the merging of tiles to heavily and fails to account for the actual arrangement of tiles on the game board. The heuristic function used is a combination of the arrangement of tiles on the board along with the location of the tiles on the board. Overall the function has been less successful than expected, and there is much room for improvement both algorithmically and within the heuristic utilized for the calculation of the score of the board.
