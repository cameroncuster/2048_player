Notes:

   * Making one simple change does not meet the requirement
     of 'All team members show repository activity'.  Make sure both team
     members are contributing
    
   * If the team is doing paired or team programming, that must be documented
     in the commit logs.

   * Projects do not, necessarily, require that all team members receive the
     same grade.  I reserve the right to assign different grades for each
     member of a team.

   * Player is working so far, so good, keep an eye on the upcoming 
     checkpoint requirements and the performance of the greedy player as it
     will improve over time.

   * Your player takes a lot of time per turn, you're currently under the 
     wire (when run on an Opp Lab machine) but make sure you're keeping an
     eye on that.
